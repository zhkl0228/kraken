# Kraken

Kraken is an opensource information security suite for java developers.

# Status

OpenSOC depends on the PCAP library of Kraken, however sometime in Jan 2015, the server hosting the library (krakenapps.org) went offline. The code for the library was forked here. Since OpenSOC only depends on a small percentage of the original Kraken code, most of the code has been removed from the master branch. We (the OpenSOC team) will maintain the code that OpenSOC depends on as long as it's needed for OpenSOC. However, we have no intention of maintaining the other parts of the code base, which is why we removed them. If you would like to use any of the code that was removed, you can see the entire code base as it was when it was forked on the branch called original.
